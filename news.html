<h2><a name="1">[RELEASE] mpdecimal-2.5.0</a></h2>
<pre>
Hi,

I've released mpdecimal-2.5.0:

   http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/index.html

15417edc8e12a57d1d9d75fa7e3f22b158a3b98f44db9d694cfd2acde8dfa0ca  mpdecimal-2.5.0.tar.gz


Starting with Python 3.9, this version should be used for an external libmpdec.


Python versions 3.7 and 3.8 should use the previous version mpdecimal-2.4.2.


libmpdec
========

libmpdec will continue to evolve conservatively.  For the few changes, see:

   http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/changelog.html


libmpdec++
==========

mpdecimal now includes libmpdec++.  libmpdec++ is a complete C++ implementation
of the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification.

   http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/doc/libmpdec++/index.html


The library frees users from manual memory management and has an easy API with
inline operators similar to the one in Python's decimal module.  Like Python's
decimal module, libmpdec++ has a thread local context for inline operators and
other functions that use the implicit context.


Depending on the compiler, the speed penalty for the C++ features compared
to libmpdec is 4-10%.

The best compiler I found is gcc (GCC) 9.2.1 20190827 (Red Hat 9.2.1-1), closely
followed by the latest Intel compiler.  Both produce the fastest libmpdec code
and have a speed penalty for C++ of 4%.


Like libmpdec, libmpdec++ has a large test suite.  In addition to the mpdecimal
tests, libmpdec++ has been tested by replacing all libmpdec functions in Python's
decimal module with libmpdec++ functions.

libmpdec++ passes both the Python test suite and deccheck.py.


For a short libmpdec++ introduction, see:

   http://www.bytereef.org/mpdecimal/quickstart.html

Acknowledgements
================

Many thanks to the growing number of people who have, and continue to,
support the project. Also our thanks to all people providing feedback
and bug reports that helps us make Trac better, easier to use and
more effective. Without your invaluable help, Trac would not evolve.
Thank you all.

Finally, we hope that Trac will be useful to like-minded programmers
around the world, and that this release will be an improvement over
the last version.

Please let us know.

<h2><a name="6">EuroPython 2020: Our Keynotes</a></h2>
<pre>We=92re happy to announce our keynote lineup for EuroPython 2020.

                      * EuroPython 2020 Keynotes *
             https://ep2020.europython.eu/events/keynotes/


Guido van Rossum - Q&A
----------------------

In this session, you=92ll get a chance to get your questions answered by
Guido van Rossum, our retired BDFL.

Siddha Ganju - 30 Golden Rules of Deep Learning Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------

=93Watching paint dry is faster than training my deep learning model.=94
=93If only I had ten more GPUs, I could train my model in time.=94
=93I want to run my model on a cheap smartphone, but it=92s probably too
heavy and slow.=94

If this sounds like you, then you might like this talk.

Exploring the landscape of training and inference, we cover a myriad of
tricks that step-by-step improve the efficiency of most deep learning
pipelines, reduce wasted hardware cycles, and make them cost-effective.
We identify and fix inefficiencies across different parts of the
pipeline, including data preparation, reading and augmentation,
training, and inference.

With a data-driven approach and easy-to-replicate TensorFlow examples,
finely tune the knobs of your deep learning pipeline to get the best out
of your hardware.  And with the money you save, demand a raise!

Naomi Ceder - Staying for the Community:
Building Community in the face of Covid-19
------------------------------------------

Python communities around the world, large and small are facing loss -
from the loss of in person meetups and conferences to the loss of
employment and even the potential loss of health and life.  As
communities we are all confronting uncertainty and unanswered questions.
In this talk I would like to reflect on some of those questions.  What
are communities doing now to preserve a sense of community in the face
of this crisis?  What might we do and what options will we have for
coming events?  How can we build and foster community and still keep
everyone safe?  What challenges might we all face in the future?  What
sources of support can we find?  What are our sources of optimism and
hope?


Alejandro Saucedo - Meditations on First Deployment:
A Practical Guide to Responsible Development
----------------------------------------------------

As the impact of software increasingly reaches farther and wider, our
professional responsibility as developers becomes more critical to
society. The production systems we design, build and maintain often
bring inherent adversities with complex technical, societal and even
ethical challenges. The skillsets required to tackle these challenges
require us to go beyond the algorithms, and require cross-functional
collaboration that often goes beyond a single developer.  In this talk
we introduce intuitive and practical insights from a few of the core
ethics themes in software including Privacy, Equity, Trust and
Transparency.  We cover their importance, the growing societal
challenges, and how organisations such as The Institute for Ethical AI,
The Linux Foundation, the Association for Computer Machinery, NumFocus,
the IEEE and the Python Software Foundation are contributing to these
critical themes through standards, policy advise and open source
software initiatives.  We finally will wrap up the talk with practical
steps that any individual can take to get involved and contribute to
some of these great open initiatives, and contribute to these critical
ongoing discussions.


EuroPython 2020 is waiting for you
----------------------------------

We=92ve compiled a full program for the event:

- more than 120 sessions,
- more than 120 speakers from around the world,
- 4 brilliant keynotes,
- 2 exciting lightning talk blocks,
- 4 all-day tracks, with a whole track dedicated to data science topics,
- a poster track,
- a virtual social event,
- an after party,
- and lots of socializing on our conference platform.

Conference tickets are available on our registration page.  We hope to
see lots of you at the conference from July 23-26.  Rest assured that
we=92ll make this a great event again =97 even within the limitations of
running the conference online.

<h2><a name="7">Nikola v8.1.1 is out!</a></h2>
<pre>This is an OpenPGP/MIME signed message (RFC 4880 and 3156)

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Language: en-US

On behalf of the Nikola team, I am pleased to announce the immediate
availability of Nikola v8.1.1. This release is mainly due to an
incorrect PGP key being used for the PyPI artifacts; three regressions
were also fixed in this release.

What is Nikola?
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.
It can use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown =E2=80=94 and can even tur=
n
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual. Nikola is flexible, and page builds are extremely
fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has been changed).

Install using `pip install Nikola`.

Changes

Bugfixes
--------

* Default to no line numbers in code blocks, honor CodeHilite

  (Issue #3426)
* Remove duplicate MathJax config in bootstrap themes (Issue #3427)
* Fix ``doit`` requirement to ``doit>=3D0.32.0`` (Issue #3422)

<h2><a name="9">Python Online Training</a></h2>
<pre>This course will help you to expertise in the usage of Python.
Programming languages have been around for ages, and every decade sees the launch of a new language sweeping developers off their feet. Python is considered one of the most popular and in-demand programming languages. A recent Stack Overflow survey showed that Python has taken over languages such as Java, C, C++ and has made its way to the top. This makes Python certification one of the most sought-after programming certifications. Through this blog, I will be listing down the top 10 reasons to learn Python.
Python is a versatile language when needed for website development.
Python is considered instrumental in AI and data science
Python excessively and uninterruptedly used in the Internet of Things
Python highly recommended when learning to code.

Python is extremely simple and easy to learn. It is a very powerful language and it closely resembles the English language!
So, what contributes to its simplicity? Python is
Free & open source
